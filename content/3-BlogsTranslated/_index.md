### **[Blog 2 – EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) & AWS IoT Compliance](3.2-Blog2/)**  
This article explores the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), a regulation that establishes mandatory cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. The blog explains the classification of digital products under CRA, essential security obligations for manufacturers, vulnerability reporting timelines, and lifecycle maintenance expectations.  

It also discusses the practical implications for organizations building IoT products and outlines how AWS IoT services—such as IoT Core, Device Defender, Device Management, and EventBridge—can support compliance with CRA’s security-by-design principles. 
 
Through real-world examples, including smart thermostat deployments, the blog demonstrates how enterprises can implement secure provisioning, access control, encryption, monitoring, patch management, and incident response workflows that align with CRA guidelines.

### **[Blog 3 – Amazon Disrupts APT29 Watering-Hole Campaign](3.3-Blog3/)**  
This security-focused article details Amazon’s investigation into a sophisticated watering-hole attack orchestrated by APT29, a nation-state threat actor. The blog describes how attackers compromised legitimate websites, injected obfuscated JavaScript, and selectively redirected users to malicious infrastructure designed to exploit Microsoft’s device code authentication flow.  

The analysis highlights key adversarial techniques, including base64-encoded payloads, randomized redirection logic, persistent infrastructure rotation, and server-side redirects. It also shares indicators of compromise (IOCs) and emphasizes Amazon’s coordinated response with industry partners such as Cloudflare and Microsoft.  

The blog concludes with actionable recommendations for both end-users and IT administrators to strengthen identity protection, adopt MFA, validate device authorization flows, and implement conditional access policies to reduce exposure to credential-harvesting campaigns.
