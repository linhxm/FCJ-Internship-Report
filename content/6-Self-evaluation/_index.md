During my internship at **AWS First Cloud Journey** from **September 4, 2025** to **December 09, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  

I directly participated in **building and deploying the Serverless architecture for the SorcererXtreme project**. Through this process, I gained specific experiences:
* **Technical Skills:** Mastered the operation and integration of core AWS services (**AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB**), practiced **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for infrastructure management, and built **CI/CD** pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
* **Mindset:** Developed a mindset for designing scalable systems and began addressing Cloud Cost Optimization challenges.
* **Soft Skills:** Honed effective **Teamwork** skills within an Agile/Scrum environment, along with transparent task management and progress reporting.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |

### Needs Improvement

To develop into a more professional engineer, I recognize the need to focus on improving the following areas:

#### 1. Technical Depth
* **Optimization Mindset:** Move beyond just "making it work" to focusing on **Performance Optimization** and **Cost Optimization** for the AWS services used in the project.
* **Security Awareness:** Apply security principles (IAM roles, Security Groups) more strictly and proactively from the early development stages.

#### 2. Workflow & Process
* **Documentation Discipline:** Maintain a habit of writing clear Technical Documentation and comprehensive code comments to facilitate future maintenance.
* **Time Management:** Improve the ability to estimate time for complex tasks to ensure more accurate deadlines.

#### 3. Soft Skills
* **Proactive Communication:** Report blockers or issues earlier instead of trying to solve them alone for too long.
* **Technical English:** Enhance the ability to comprehend in-depth documentation and communicate technical concepts in English.
