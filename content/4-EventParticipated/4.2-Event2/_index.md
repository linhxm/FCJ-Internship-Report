# Workshop: Data Science on AWS

> **Time:** 9:30 – 11:45, October 16, 2025 <br>
> **Location:** Hall A - FPT University HCMC (FPTU HCMC) <br>
> **Role:** Attendee

### Objectives
- Understand the complete Landscape of AWS AI/ML services.
- Learn how to build, train, and deploy real-world Machine Learning models.
- Network with experts from the AWS User Group community.

### Speakers

- Van Hoang Kha - Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS User Group Leader
- Bach Doan Vuong - Cloud DevOps Engineer, AWS Community Builder

### Key Highlights

#### 1. The AWS AI/ML Stack
The speakers clearly introduced the 3-layer structure of the AWS AI/ML Stack:
- **AI Services (Top layer):** Ready-to-use services requiring no deep ML expertise (Vision, Speech, Chatbots, etc.).
- **ML Services (Middle layer):** Amazon SageMaker platform for building, training, and deploying models.
- **Frameworks & Infrastructure (Bottom layer):** For experts needing deep control (PyTorch, TensorFlow, EC2 GPU...).

#### 2. Featured AI Services & Demos
I found this section incredibly interesting due to its high applicability for student projects:
- **Vision:** **Amazon Rekognition** for face recognition, video analysis, PPE Detection, and Content Moderation.
- **Speech & Audio:** The combination of **Amazon Polly** (Text-to-Speech with lifelike voices) and **Amazon Transcribe** (Speech-to-Text, supporting real-time calls).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    - **Amazon Translate:** Fast, multi-language translation.
    - **Amazon Textract:** Quickly extract data from scanned documents/invoices.
    - **Amazon Lex:** Build intelligent conversational Chatbots.
- **Personalization:** **Amazon Personalize** creates real-time product recommendations without needing deep ML expertise.

#### 3. Machine Learning Workflow with SageMaker
The speakers demonstrated the process from **Feature Engineering** (raw data processing) to Training and Tuning parameters. Specifically, they showed how to bring existing Python code (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) to run on AWS's powerful infrastructure.

### Personal Experience

This workshop was very practical and relevant for students like me.
- I was particularly impressed by the sharing on **Amazon Personalize**. I used to think building a Recommendation System was extremely difficult and required complex algorithms, but AWS makes it much simpler.
- A huge plus was the speaker's practical advice on **Cost Management**. The "Monitoring Cost Daily" slide made me realize that working with Cloud isn't just about making code run, but also about optimizing costs to avoid "wallet shock" at the end of the month.
- The atmosphere at FPTU was energetic. Hearing experiences from industry seniors gave me more motivation to study for my upcoming AWS certifications.

> **Summary:** This event truly "enlightened" me about the AI Services toolkit. Instead of building models from scratch, I now know how to leverage AWS's available APIs to solve problems faster and more effectively.
