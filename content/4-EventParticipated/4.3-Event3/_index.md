# AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

> **Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025, 8:30 – 12:00 <br>
> **Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City <br>
> **Role:** Attendee (Learner)

### Event Objectives

- Gain a comprehensive overview of the **AI/ML landscape in Vietnam** and the holistic AWS AI service ecosystem.
- Deep dive into **Amazon SageMaker** to understand the end-to-end MLOps process, from data preparation to model deployment.
- Master core **Generative AI** technologies on Amazon Bedrock, specifically Prompt Engineering and RAG.
- Understand the strategic shift from passive Chatbots to autonomous **Agentic AI**.

### Speakers

- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi:** Expert in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and the Agent ecosystem.
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh:** Demonstrated Pre-trained AI Services and real-world applications (AMZ Photo).
- **Lam Tuan Kiet:** Specialist in Generative AI, Prompt Engineering techniques, and RAG architecture.

### Key Highlights

The event focused on three main pillars of the AWS AI Stack:

1.  **AI Services (Pre-trained):**
    - Introduction to ready-to-use services like Amazon Rekognition (image analysis), Transcribe (speech-to-text), and Polly (text-to-speech).
    - Demo of **AMZ Photo**: A smart photo management app featuring face search and a multimodal chatbot built with the Pipecat framework.

2.  **Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock:**
    - Comparison of Foundation Models (Claude, Llama, Titan).
    - Optimization techniques for Prompt Engineering: Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
    - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** Architecture: Combining language models with enterprise data via Vector Databases.

3.  **Agentic AI & AgentCore:**
    - The evolution from Generative AI Assistants to Agentic AI (capable of autonomous execution).
    - Introduction to **AgentCore**: Components such as Memory, Identity, Gateway, and Code Interpreter that enable Agents to operate at scale.

### Key Takeaways

- **Prompt Engineering Mindset:** Prompting is not just simple questioning but a natural language programming technique. Using *Chain-of-Thought* significantly improves the model's ability to solve complex logic problems compared to standard querying.
- **Standard RAG Process:** Understanding the data flow (Data Ingestion -> Embeddings -> Vector Store -> Semantic Search) is crucial to solving AI hallucination issues.
- **Power of Pre-trained Services:** Building models from scratch is not always necessary. Leveraging existing APIs (like Rekognition, Textract) drastically reduces Time-to-market.
- **Agent Architecture:** grasping the distinction between a passive Chatbot and an active Agent capable of using Tools and accessing the Browser Viewer.

### Applying to Work

- **Optimize Internal Chatbots:** Immediately apply **RAG** architecture and **Titan Text Embeddings V2** to upgrade the company's technical documentation support bot, ensuring answers are accurate and based on actual data sources.
- **Automate Document Processing:** Propose using **Amazon Textract** combined with **Comprehend** to extract and classify information from invoices/contracts, replacing manual data entry processes.
- **Research Agentic Workflows:** Pilot a simple Agent using **LangGraph** or **Amazon Bedrock Agents** to automate the daily market news summarization process for the Business team.

### Personal Experience

Attending the AWS Cloud Mastery Series at the AWS Vietnam office was professionally valuable for me:

- Mr. **Lam Tuan Kiet's** session was highly practical, especially the illustrative examples of Prompt Engineering. It helped me realize previous mistakes in interacting with LLMs and how to scientifically improve response quality.
- Mr. **Dinh Le Hoang Anh's** demo with the AMZ Photo app was impressive. The integration of Multimodal capabilities and real-time processing demonstrated the immense potential of combining various AWS services.
- Mr. **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi's** topic on Agentic AI was very forward-looking. Although the AgentCore architecture is complex, it opens up a new perspective where AI is not just a support tool but can become a true "virtual employee."
