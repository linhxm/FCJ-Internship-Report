### 1. Professional Growth & Skills

**1. Knowledge & Technology**
* **Tech stack:** Over the past 3 months, I have truly mastered AWS Core Services (EC2, S3, RDS) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) – topics I previously only knew in theory. Additionally, I got hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, an area that AI students like me often overlook.
* **Theory vs. Reality:** At university, as long as the code runs, it's done (Happy Case). At FCJ, I learned that running code is not enough; it must be cost-optimized, secure, and scalable.
* **Biggest Challenge:** Migrating a database from on-premise to the Cloud. Handling data synchronization without causing service downtime was the toughest problem I solved.

**2. Soft Skills & Workflow**
* **Skills:** The skill of "Asking the right questions" is what I honed the most. Instead of just asking "Why is this broken?", I learned to frame it as "I tried A and B, but got result C. Is my approach correct?".
* **Workflow:** I really appreciate the strict Code Review process. The feedback from seniors didn't just catch syntax errors but also suggested ways to write cleaner, more optimized code.

### 2. People & Culture

**3. Mentorship Experience**
* **Style:** My mentor follows a "Coaching" style – never giving the answer immediately but asking leading questions so I can find the solution myself. This was challenging at first but helped me retain knowledge effectively.
* **Impression:** The mentor's calmness during system incidents. Instead of panicking, he guided the team step-by-step to trace logs and fix the issue systematically.

**4. Culture & Connection**
* **Atmosphere:** The working environment is very flat and open. I felt comfortable debating technical solutions with Mentors without fear of judgment, as long as I had logical arguments.
* **Events:** Beyond the "day in the life" office experiences, FCJ and the seniors organized many professional sharing sessions, helping everyone gain a deeper and broader perspective on AWS.

### 3. Operations & Support

**5. Admin Team & FCJ Team Role**
* **Onboarding:** The internal "Cloud Journey" documentation is incredibly detailed. It even predicts common errors and provides ready-made solutions for newbies.
* **Support:** The Admin team is very enthusiastic. Just be brave enough to ask, and you will definitely get support.

**6. Facilities**
* **Workspace:** Open office layout with comfortable ergonomic chairs. Although the space was occasionally a bit crowded, the atmosphere remained pleasant and never stifling.

### 4. Retrospective & Suggestions

**Key Takeaways**
> *The most memorable (and painful) lesson: Every mistake on the Cloud costs actual money. Creating AWS services and forgetting to delete resources is a sure way to make your wallet "evaporate" in the blink of an eye.*

**Areas for Improvement**
* **Improvement:** The program should add a workshop on "Technical Writing," as I noticed many interns (including myself) are still weak in this area.
* **Training:** I hope to have more in-depth sharing sessions on specific service techniques in future batches.

**Final Thoughts**
* Thank you, FCJ team, for giving me a memorable experience and wonderful colleagues!
